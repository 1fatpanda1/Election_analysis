# Election_analysis

## Overview
We are helping Tom audit the congressional election poll data for an election in Colorado. We used Python to read the data in a csv file containing the ballot ID, county, and candidateâ€™s name. Then we used Python to calculate the total votes for each candidate and each county in which a vote was cast. Given this data, we were able to calculate the winning candidate, the percentage of votes they received, as well as the county with the most votes. This data was then stored in a new text file created by Python.
